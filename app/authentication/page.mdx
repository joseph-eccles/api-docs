# Authentication

To access the **BookStore API**, you need to authenticate your requests using an API key. Authentication is required for all endpoints to ensure that requests come from authorized users.

## Obtaining an API Key

To obtain an API key:

1. Sign up for a **BookStore API** account at [https://bookstore.com/signup](https://bookstore.com/signup).
2. Once logged in, navigate to the **API Keys** section in your account settings.
3. Click **Generate API Key** to create a new key.
4. Copy the generated API key and keep it secure. You'll need this key to authenticate your requests.

> **Note:** Treat your API key like a password. Do not share it publicly or hard-code it in your client-side applications.

## Using the API Key

You need to include your API key in the request header for each API request. The header should be named `Authorization`, and the value should be in the format `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`.

### Example Header

Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY

## Example Request in JavaScript

Hereâ€™s how you can authenticate a request to retrieve the list of books using JavaScript with the `fetch` API:

<CodeBlock
  code={`const apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY";
fetch("https://api.bookstore.com/v1/books", {
method: "GET",
headers: {
Authorization: \`Bearer \${apiKey}\`,
"Content-Type": "application/json",
},
})
.then((response) => {
if (!response.ok) {
throw new Error(\`HTTP error! Status: \${response.status}\`);
}
return response.json();
})
.then((data) => {
console.log("Books:", data);
})
.catch((error) => {
console.error("Error fetching books:", error);
});`}
  language="javascript"
/>

If the request is successful, the response will contain the list of books. If authentication fails, the response will be a 401 Unauthorized error.

## Error Codes

If authentication fails, the following error codes may be returned:

- **401 Unauthorized:** The API key is missing or invalid.
- **403 Forbidden:** The API key does not have permission to access the requested resource.

## Best Practices for API Key Security

- **Keep your API key private:** Never share your API key or expose it in client-side code.
- **Rotate your API key regularly:** Periodically generate a new key and update your applications to use the new key.
- **Use separate API keys for different environments:** For example, use different keys for development, staging, and production environments.
