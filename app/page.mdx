# Welcome to the Bookshop API Documentation

The Bookshop API allows you to manage books, authors, and other resources in an online bookshop. With this API, you can perform a variety of operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting records. The documentation is designed to help developers integrate the API quickly and effectively.

## Key Features

- **Manage Books and Authors**  
  Easily create, update, and delete book and author records.
- **Search and Filter Capabilities**  
  Perform complex searches with filtering options to find books and authors.
- **Versioned API**  
  Supports multiple versions, allowing for backward compatibility and controlled upgrades.
- **Error Handling**  
  Detailed error messages and status codes to help you troubleshoot and resolve issues.

## Getting Started

To begin using the Bookshop API, we recommend following these steps:

1. **Read the [Quick Start Guide](./api-docs/quick-start-guide)** to get familiar with basic API interactions.
2. **Explore the [Books](./api-docs/books)** resource to understand the structure and fields of Books.
3. **Make Your First Request**: Try out the example requests provided in the documentation to interact with the API.

## Authentication and Authorization

Most endpoints require authentication. If you haven't already, set up authentication by obtaining an API token or key. Refer to the [Authentication](./api-docs/authentication) page for details on how to authenticate your requests.

## Best Practices

When working with the Bookshop API, consider the following best practices:

- **Handle Errors Gracefully**: Always check the response status codes and handle errors such as `404 Not Found` or `500 Internal Server Error` appropriately.
- **Secure API Requests**: Use authentication methods such as tokens to protect the API endpoints from unauthorized access.
- **Version Control**: Specify the API version in your requests to ensure you are using the correct version. See the [API Versioning](./api-docs/versioning) section for details.
- **Optimize Data Usage**: Use pagination and filtering options to limit the amount of data retrieved in each request.
