# Welcome to the BookStore API Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for the **BookStore API**, a powerful and easy-to-use API for managing books, authors, and customer orders in an online bookstore. This documentation will guide you through the available endpoints, authentication, and example requests to help you get started quickly.

## Overview

The **BookStore API** enables you to:

- **Manage Books**: Create, retrieve, update, and delete book information.
- **Handle Authors**: Keep track of authors and their details.
- **Process Orders**: Manage customer orders, including placing, updating, and canceling orders.

The API follows REST principles and is designed to be simple and easy to integrate. All responses are in JSON format, and we use standard HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of requests.
